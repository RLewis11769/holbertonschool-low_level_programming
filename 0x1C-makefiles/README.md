# 0x1C. C - Makefiles

## Mandatory

### 0-Makefile
- Builds simple executable

### 1-Makefile
- Builds simple exectuable using variables

### 2-Makefile
- Builds executable with name by linking .o files

### 3-Makefile
- Builds executable and cleans after

### 4-Makefile
- Builds executable and cleans after with flags

### 5-island_perimeter.py
- Technical interview preparation (theoretically)
- Returns perimeter of island with grid borders
    - Prototype: def island_perimeter(grid):
    - Used with: 5main.py

## Advanced

### 100-Makefile
- Builds executable and cleans after
    - Works if file in folder with name of rule
    - Should not work without header
    - Flags used implicitly
    - Limitations on variables and rules

## Learning Objectives
- What are make, Makefiles
- When, why and how to use Makefiles
- What are rules and how to set and use them
- What are explicit and implicit rules
- What are the most common / useful rules
- What are variables and how to set and use them
